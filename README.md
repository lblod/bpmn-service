# BPMN service Open Proces Huis

One of the Open Proces Huis' main functionalities lies in the processing of BPMN files. One the one hand, the process steps that make up a BPMN file process should be converted to triples and subsequently inserted into a given triplestore, and on the other, BPMN files should be available for download in different formats, which requires a conversion step. Both functionalities are handled by the OPH BPMN service, whose implementation can be found in this repo.
